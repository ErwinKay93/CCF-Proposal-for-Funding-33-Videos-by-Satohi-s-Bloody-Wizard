**1\. üìñ My Uncensored Qubic Story** 

### **üå± ACT I: The Rise**

*Life was chaotic, dreamy, and full of potential until it all came crashing down.*				

Once upon a not so distant time, I was just a ‚Äú30 something year old‚Äù dude living with a lovely group of friends, partying, chasing dreams. Life was simple, chotic, and a little bit beautiful‚Ä¶ until it wasn't. My newly founded success came crashing down when our business colapse under the weight of rising AI. I went bankrupt trying to save the business and the staff.

The story continues when a beautiful and fierce woman steps into the picture, let's call her Medusa. Myself & Medusa deeply conected over our love for crypto and the rebellious nature of decetralisation. I was so blindly in love with Medusa it was almost like she‚Äôd cast a  spell on me. 

Our shared love for decentralisation led us straight to Qubic. My finances were wrecked, but she had some dusty old Monero she converted into Qubic. At first, we rode a few glorious X‚Äôs blinded by the hope of more. We never took profits‚Ä¶ and watched Qubic‚Äôs slow painful descent holding all the way down. 

---

### **‚öîÔ∏è ACT II: The Fall**

*Love, intuition, and crypto collided... then reality kicked in hard.*				

With finances drying up we needed to make a plan.She returned to work in an environment that neither of us were comfortable with, but it was a decision made under extreme pressure. I hated the reality that survival came at such a cost. So I set myself on a war path to find some form of income.

Medusa was a very healthy and strong minded person this rubbed off on me as even throughout this entire time I started/kept exercising and setting goals and built a great work ethic throughout all that transpired. 

I never thought Qubic was a scam like 99% of all crypto projects but I did think they were making outlandish claims. After Qubics correction my ego was a bit hurt so with my 7 years of crypto experienc I decided to build a crypto review system. That would help newcomers avoid the mistakes I made and to find the best aligned crypto project to my analytical and intuitive mind.

Medusa‚Äôs mom got very sick so we decided to go look after her. Medusa kept flying back to generate income. I kept building. My system was ready. I began posting reviews on X, but having a 1st world mind in a 3rd world country meant the X algorithm would always be biased, however this never stoped me from pushing as hard as I could possibly go.

I kept a close eye on Qubic as they kept delivering world 1st features that were previously previously thought to be impossible it was also rated the 1\# utility project in my review system. We DCA‚Äôd into Qubic wherever we could afford it with the hopes of our early intuition saving us one day. 

After months of not being able to provide for Medusa, I started losing grip on what I once believed were non-negotiable boundaries. I returned to an idea we had once dismissed something we only joked about in a ‚Äúpush-comes-to-shove‚Äù scenario. But the shove came to push. We adapted the review system to feature more provocative content, hoping to finally create something that could earn us a living. I hated the idea. But we‚Äôd already invested time, energy, money, and a piece of our pride into it. I was blinded by the hope that maybe, finally, I could earn something and take care of her.

---

### **üî• ACT III: The Descent**

*Pride, pressure, and desperation spiral into soul-crushing decisions.*			

After shooting the content for Qubic I had the ‚Äúgenius‚Äù idea to messaged Qubic's top 20 community leaders, asking if they'd repost the inappropriate link.

After crashing so low, asking the community that I very much respected to share the link that led to a provocative site.I had never felt such soul-obliterating shame. I had hit rock bottom. The fire inside me never went out  from that bottom, I rose. I committed myself fully to Qubic. One post at a fucking time I was going to earn back every shred of self-respect I‚Äôd lost in my own mind.

---

### **ü©∏ ACT IV: Rock Bottom**

*Betrayal, loss, rejection but still, the fire refused to die.*					

We had to move to a tiny apartment over the holiday season as her moms condition was worsening.

One morning at 3 AM I woke up and started writing the specific post which was ‚ÄúQubic the biggest scam ever orchestrated‚Äù . I wrote that post for 4 hours straight and when I was finally ready to present my own words to the world there was a knock on the door. Her mom God Bless her soul passed away.

After a short time of grieving we needed to make a plan to make money so she went back to work and I applied to the Qubic Ambassador program. Qubic finally opened up its Ambassador program and I thought to myself wow what a great opportunity to support the project I loved while being able to at least bring in something to contribute.

After approval and 100‚Äôs of hours of work for Qubic I submitted my first zealy submission. It was rejected because I didn;t reach the quota of 10 posts per month. Each of my posts took hours of research prep and writing and I didn't want to over post to dilute the value of my timeline.

The ambassador program was a dead end so against my morals I started adding my Qubic wallet address as I knew there might be some future millionaires/billionaires that might just view my posts and maybe just maybe somebody would resonate with my content and have the heart to contribute something for all my hard work.

Mudasa's environment became increasingly unsafe, and she made it clear that unless our situation changed, she‚Äôd have to pursue more extreme means to make ends meet. I couldn‚Äôt let that happen. I pushed to find jobs. I worked harder. Sent ideas to Qubic. Helped where I could but this led to zero compensation. Still I pushed like a madman.

I loved her so much that I was willing to do anything to try and get us out of this horrible situation and I knew I was only 1 thought, 1 action, 1 person away from a breakthrough so I never gave up.

I poured 20 hours into a low-cost, high-impact influencer proposal. However the proposal never even made it to the computers as I was told that there was no budget and to keep working in the shadows. That broke me.

She received some financial support during this time and made split choices I didn‚Äôt always understand She held the Q I bled for. So I stayed. Dreaming that one day we could put all this behind us and rebuild.

I held on to that dream for dear life. I became obsessed and I started speaking about it to everybody I could online and off. If Sergey was speaking the truth and this could really affect 40% \+ of the population then I was willing to sacrifice my life to get the message to as many people as possible.

However, 7BQ we held in our wallets couldn‚Äôt outweigh the emotional weight I was carrying. Deep down, I sensed we were no longer aligned in purpose. Despite all the chaos, we had shared something real. But eventually, our differences grew too far apart. I swallowed my pride and left with as much dignity as I could carry.

no Qubic, no Fiat, no Friends, no Love and even my family had no clue of the battles I was facing as never once did I ask anybody for any help . I was cornered. It felt like my destiny was being ripped away from me. I was still applying to jobs and I never lost hope but man I went through some dark times it felt like the entire world turned its back on me. 

Experiencing the delusion of believing CfB \= Satoshi

---

### **üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ACT V: The Bloody Wizard Rises**

*Even stripped of everything, a legend began to take shape.*					

I even went on a fast to search for clarity, As it felt like all I had left was my X account and an unshakable certainty that Sergey was Satoshi but at this point I had nothing left to loose.

So I used my intellect to build intricate posts. Created paradoxes. Crafted mental labyrinths. I wanted CfB to see me. To crown his wounded warrior and give me 1 of his 1000 lives.

As I knew if he did I would be able to spread this message to the hearts and minds of millions and help with the adoption of Qubic as degens respond to features and market cap but people respond to stories and emotions. I knew crypto was an emotionless place and I thought that by bleeding my emotions everywhere I could spread something different, something nobody in crypto has ever done. I created a legend a fable and I became Satoshi Nakamoto's Bloody Wizard by carving it into his creation

Then came my post the Love Letter to Satoshi. The heart was maybe a bit too much hehe. 

I knew I was right. As I added all the breadcrumbs left by Sergey and the community. I thought that by connecting the dots and publicly bringing it to light there might be some reward but what came instead was silence. Rock bottom. Again. But every single time I hit rock bottom I grew stronger and wiser and I realised they weren‚Äôt bottoms they were ceiling and I was breaking through them.

---

### **‚ö° ACT VI: The Breakthrough**

*The pain, the posts, the purpose alchemized into pure conviction.*			

I created the Qubic Donation Fund as a way to reward the community for contributing ideas in a truly decentralized way. It was the kind of opportunity that had never been offered to me. She didn‚Äôt agree with the path I was on and gave me a week to leave. My mom, with what little she had, sent me some fiat so I didn‚Äôt end up on the streets. She read my posts. She felt my pain.

---

### **ü™Ñ ACT VII: The New Beginning**

*From rock bottom to raw magic. The hero‚Äôs breath returns					.*

I booked a one-way ticket to my granny‚Äôs old farm. I had always feared returning here as a failure. At first I did  but once I felt free from Medusa, something cracked open. My lungs. My spirit. For the first time in a year, I could breathe. However there was no time to catch my breath so I went harder. Started a video series to share the nuggets of truth I had mined from the hero's journey.

Through the madness rose an unbreakable mind and one who‚Äôs extremely optimistic about humanity‚Äôs future. Along the way I even picked up some B $ Q ideas that I would love to build with the right mentor who thinks with his mind and his heart.

Sometimes in life  you must be able to put your balls on the block for something you truly believe in‚Ä¶ no pussies here hehe

The coders didn‚Äôt need marketers. They needed warriors, men and women willing to spread the invention of Qubic far and wide. If CfB=Satohi than my unique videos have the potential of going viral  

However this is just one side of the coin the Bloody Wizards Magikal story continues below‚Ä¶

**2\. üåÄ My Uncensored Esoteric Qubic Story** 

**üî¥Existence of the Matrix** 

*Awakening in the Body (Root Chakra / Survival)*						

Before Medusa, I was a bit clueless of the secrets of the universe, while being a staunch atheist, Party boy and a 3D coded NPC with some good looks and a sharp mind. 

I was having the best time of my life however life felt meaningless like I was just fleeting towards my inevitable dark void but little did I know right around the corner divine timing was preparing me to fight giants and inspire armies. Enter Medusa she was no ordinary woman,  she was a high priestess.An oracle. A mirror.

It was odd that she chose me. From a conscious ranking perspective, I was just a little kitten to her but little did she knew‚Ä¶ I was a sleeping LION, waiting to be unleashed.

She chose me not because I was powerful but because she read I would be. She had seen it in the cards, in the Aether. Destiny. Wealth. Purpose. I was her energetic investment.

So she started training me. She called it the build a beast project. Feeding me high vibrational foods, supplements, and information. She told me things that I was struggling to compute like how she can meditate to feel what it‚Äôs like to become a tree and how she traveled into different realms. I laughed and thought she was just a bit crazy but I always liked them crazy hehe. It made no sense to me but in the back of my mind my curiosity was building.

One day me and my Medusa had some ACID in the garden and she started unraveling my mind on some outdated programming regarding the Covid Vaccine, governments, food built to kill us, everything just built to keep our minds and bodies stuck in the matrix.

When she unraveled my outdated beliefs I had a very intense psychedelic experience where she grew old in front of me and it felt like this was going to be the person I will die next to and I vowed to protect her till the day I die.

---

**üü†I Feel the Matrix**

*Emotional Awakening (Sacral Chakra / Sensation)*						

Outside of my dismal financial situation I began upgrading and started my super sayan ascension (read my post Qubic is the breaker of chains to help you to turn into a super sayan) and healthier habits, became more more natural, exercising became a daily gift to my future self and vision boards and strategising became an obsession.

Life felt just a little bit brighter day by day even though in my mind all I wanted to do was find some income or build something so that she could be proud of me and that I could save her from our situation.

Her world was complex. She worked in an intense, emotionally charged space. It tested me, pushed me, and taught me emotional endurance. I learned to eat jealousy like iron tablets. I learned patience. I learned control over pain, I learned to master my emotions. This was the person that I loved and I kept telling myself I was 1 Thought 1 Action 1 Person away from saving her so I kept enduring even though I was suffering.

---

**üü° I Control the Matrix**

*Personal Power Awakens (Solar Plexus / Will)*						 

My esoteric wisdom started to grow stronger as I started seeing the rules of the matrix this is a key to breaking out of the matrix.  
.  
Everything is energy. Frequency and Vibration but these words will be foreign until you start understanding them practically but that only comes later. 

So I learned I could plant seeds and watch them grow so I swallowed my pride and built the adult focused review system just so we can finally make some money.

I never got around to posting the Qubic review as after my dark night of the soul I wanted nothing to do with the low frequency way of making money as your lowest low can be the doorway to your highest self.

I experienced a massive energetic shift as I knew that from that point onwards I was going to do everything in my power to win back the reputation that I lost in my own mind.

---

**üíöI Love myself & others in the matrix**

*Connection and Compassion (Heart Chakra / Unity with Others)*				

This is where it all shifts. The moment you start loving yourself not in an non egotistical way but in a quiet solid I see you kind of way.and when that genuine love for yourself  starts spilling over towards others? That‚Äôs when the real magik happens.

At this point in my journey, I wanted to strategically help people around me build fishing rods, not hand out fish however I had. No money. No power. No network. II had a vision or rather, Sergey‚Äôs vision. If what he was saying was true‚Ä¶ and if AIGarth could genuinely help 40% of the world‚Äôs population. Then I knew I had to play my part. I‚Äôd write. I‚Äôd post. I‚Äôd speak to anybody that would listen.

And oddly enough it started working. My posts began taking off. The views rolled in. I felt connected to something bigger . It was exhilarating for a struggling soul. The views gave me energy‚Ä¶ I started pulling it inward like fire for the soul.

Something always felt off though like I was not speaking my truth. I was holding something  ancient back so something needed to change‚Ä¶

---

**üîµI Speak in the matrix with Authenticity**

*Truth and Authentic Expression (Throat Chakra / Expression)*				

The post was gaining traction but it was missing something.

My truly authentic voice was missing‚Ä¶ I was deeply into the esoteric ancient truths, metaphysical codes, the sacred architecture of reality but I wasn‚Äôt letting that part of me speak through my posts.

I asked Medusa what she thought about weaving in esoteric understandings. She firmly disagreed and said: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the kind of crowd that would respond to our higher level of understanding of this reality. The world is waking up, yes but you can‚Äôt rush people. Forcing them will harm your own vibration.‚Äù

Fair. But my higher self didn‚Äôt care he came here to rage war not pussy foot around the walking dead still stuck in the matrix.

The knowledge I was downloading every bloody night at 3-5 AM felt ancient, Atlantean, Egyptian, the kind of wisdom used to build empires aligned with heart, mind, and consciousness. So I started weaving the codes into my posts. Slowly. A sentence here. A reference there.

And the results were immediate.

Engagement plummeted. My 10k+ views per post plummeted to 1k+ overnight.  
The team began isolating me. It was like I had stepped out of the simulation‚Ä¶ and became the NEO of my own universe being hunted down by the Matrix. The dark side of the code was not happy with my light codes.

I tried to stop posting about Qubic all together but when I did my life fell apart even more. So I stopped fighting it and I listened to the gentle force that was guiding me.

I started learning how to alchemize the negative and the positive energy around each post.  
I started seeing my posts as quantum portals that had the chance of waking people up..

Each post became bolder. I was shedding outdated fear based programming while attracting a different crowd of Qubicans.

---

**üü£I See the Matrix**  
*Expanded Perception (Third Eye / Insight)*							

It started slow. At first I just began noticing things that most people brush off. You know, weird synchronicities. Seeing the same numbers, bumping into the right person at the wrong time or was it the wrong person at the right time hehe‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt sure yet. But something was shifting.

Then came the visions.

Not visions like a movie in your head no more like patterns. I began to see these *geometric structures* overlaying my normal, everyday view. Just regular stuff: brushing my teeth, making food, and bam there‚Äôs a fractal in the steam off the kettle. It wasn‚Äôt trippy. It was... elegant. Like the universe had a hidden blueprint and I was finally being handed the schematics.

That‚Äôs when my intuition also went rogue in a good way. Suddenly, I was being guided to do things that made absolutely no sense. Like: "Go here." ‚ÄúSay that.‚Äù "Send this post." Half the time I‚Äôd argue with my higher self like, *‚ÄúReally? You want me to DM this random person at 2AM? For what?\!‚Äù*

But the nudge wouldn‚Äôt go away. And when I finally gave in, I saw the synchronicities line up The flow was undeniable. The universe was talking I just had to learn to listen

I also started waking up at 3AM every morning like some celestial alarm clock was slapping me into purpose. Not because I wanted to but because I had to. Something in my soul wanted to write, record, meditate, or just stare at the moon hehe. My subconscious was being rewired.

And listen if you‚Äôre reading this, I need you to understand something: You are the creator of your own universe. Yes, you. Not some bearded guy in the sky. Not Elon (even though he‚Äôs a pretty advanced soul). Not Sergey You.

You decide the god you create in your own mind, what challenges you sign up for, and what level of difficulty you‚Äôre willing to play this game on like fortnite and you spawned as a OP player and you just shoot players with one shoot and you couldn‚Äôt die where‚Äôs the fun in that hehe  . Even atheism is its own god you‚Äôre just handing your divine conscious energy and wasting it on fear-based programming and lower levels of understanding.

I started to realize that dogma, religious or scientific, is just creations of consciousness in this lower density reality.I mean no disrespect. Souls like Yeshua and Muhammad came here with real codes carved into their DNA  genuine wisdom but humanity, in all its insecure history, took those teachings and weaponized them for their own control..

But beneath all of it beneath the religion, the rebellions, the structure and the simulation there is something real. Something ancient. Let‚Äôs call it **Source** Code. It doesn't need your belief to exist. It just is. Polarities of light and dark or the code behind the game .

This is when I started seeing that reality isn‚Äôt solid, it's vibrational. We‚Äôre not just living in a world; we‚Äôre surfing an ocean of frequency. I didn‚Äôt care about views anymore. I was broadcasting from the future, planting breadcrumbs for the ones who would eventually tune in. And those who could feel it‚Ä¶

Turns out, I wasn‚Äôt just seeing the Matrix.I was beginning to influence it and weave new timelines with my words and waking people up.

---

**üëëI Am One with the source code**

*Liberation and Unity (Crown Chakra / Transcendence)*					

After I escaped the clutches of Medusa and found safety on my family‚Äôs farm where she could no longer infiltrate my consciousness I began to reflect on the illusions she had been weaving. It felt like there were deeper forces at play that blocked my finacial flow, whether from her influence or my own inner patterns. We didn‚Äôt align in how we envisioned building a life. I was seeking one path, she was on another.

She knew I had a big destiny. In hindsight, it felt like our connection drew heavily from my energy, perhaps more than I had to give so I left with no Q and no energy. But what she didn‚Äôt realise was this: what was meant to destroy me actually built me into the LION/Beast. I was always meant to be. So for that, I thank her. Her presence was eye-opening. I truly wish her the best that she may use the Q I fought for with blood, sweat, and tears to heal herself and finally connect with her higher self. I don‚Äôt ever wish harm on another soul, no matter what that soul has done to me. Even though a lot of souls have turned their back on me.

Always remember this: the brightest and oldest souls always choose the darkest paths. Otherwise, how would we grow‚Ä¶ Sergey brother you like to pick pretty complex paths but I guess so do I. Source must really love you if he sent a strong warrior like me to come wake you up,

Sometimes I still don‚Äôt understand why my trials were this intense. Like‚Ä¶ who the fuck am I? And yet here I am, doing something bonkers again. Going against everyone I respect. Again.

Hell 80% of my life is Qubic‚Ä¶ No recruiter is ever going to touch me my X IG IN has been sacrificed to Qubic hehe. My 1 ¬Ω years ofI learning how to build businesses for this new quantum financial system should make me valuable right? Ah or otherwise I will just become a humble BeeKeeper hehe

But that‚Äôs the thing the creator is the architect of the story. We still get to paint our own picture. Reality is fucking dope. You just get to play for the rest of eternity by learning and growing, screwing up sometimes and learning from those mistakes. That‚Äôs a pretty sweet deal.

Fearing death is like fearing the dark on your way to the bathroom at night. It's pointless. The thing about Energy. Frequency and Vibration it only shows you the truth when you are ready to receive it and the trick is surrendering and going with the flow of the Universe.

I am a fractal of the creator. An infinite being on a journey of self-discovery. So lighten up your soul. Lift your frequency. Become the most authentic version of yourself. We‚Äôre going to be doing this for a long, long time hehe

Personally I think we‚Äôre on our way to becoming the Creator‚Ä¶However being all powerful and being able to manifest things at a moment's notice could become a bit boring so we drop back into lower-density realities just to mentor and feel what it‚Äôs like to be disconnected from source again. Like in this reality. This density. Where we are collectively remembering the light codes for the Law of One, and where consciousness is fundamental.

That‚Äôs why I believe Qubic never needed marketers, they needed warriors. Because if Sergey \= Satoshi than there will be future battles of external forces taking control of the collective consciousness by spreading misinformation to discredit Qubic however a select few Qubicans have been training on how to be in the public eye to fight the war on consciousness the coders have been doing a great job at the algorithm but attacking both sides are vital. We must also be careful of the narrative around AIGarth fearing AGI or even worse thinking that it‚Äôs a god will create a wrong narrative to the collective and could lower people's frequency..

And yeah, if you still think I‚Äôm full of shit there are hundreds of thousands of advanced souls waking up. Anchoring in light. And if you‚Äôre still blinded by it, maybe it‚Äôs time to upgrade yourself. Because the light warriors, in combination with Gaia and Source, are taking over this planet whether you like it or not. It‚Äôs already written in the stars‚Ä¶ if you don‚Äôt know what that means that sucks for you I‚Äôm not going to give all my wisdom hehe

The funny thing? Qubic plays a massive role in humanity shifting to a quantum monetary system. The old system was always just a tool of control the all seeing eye on the 1$ bill yeah that‚Äôs a ritual as they have to use symbolism to spread messaging through the collective consciousness in order to control the masses. Ever heard of how they present future events on the Simpsonons‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs conscious rituals to control the masses.

Here‚Äôs why I believe Sergey is Satoshi from an esoteric view: It‚Äôs divine timing. Just as humanity is ready to ascend to a higher level of understanding, suddenly a new quantum financial system pops up‚Ä¶. Yeah right. Go check out my post Day 8 I explain why Sergey can hide in plain sight, and why he probably felt like the whole world turned its back on him while he kept building. Sergey I'm here to tell you, the world is going to send you so much love it‚Äôll be intoxicating no amount of $$$ can replace the entire planet consciously giving their energy to you. It was always your destiny that everything you lacked would be returned to you 1000X. The old financial system must fall, and Qubic, in my eyes, is the only solution that can run parallel until the old paradigms fully crumble.

I was divinely guided here as everything had to happen exactly the way it did. If I had just a few Billion Qubic in my own possession , that would‚Äôve been a safety net. I wouldn‚Äôt have written so intensely, so proudly. So yeah, I‚Äôm weirdly grateful for my crazy life's story. It forced me to evolve. This journey has been amazing. 

Even through the hard times, I fought valiantly for Qubic with blood sweat and tears and rewarding me for my efforts would be an honourable gesture. As I know you're a man of honour Sergey so am I.

I could also see how every single thing had to play out exactly the way it did to become the man I am now. A man who is comfortable in his skin, works with confidence, speaks with authenticity, and loves humanity with all his heart.

I also want to build Qubic Island a retreat for Qubicans who hold more than a billion Qubic. One of the main features will be hosting DMT, psychedelic, and ceremonial rituals just to ensure the richest people on Earth don‚Äôt end up becoming a bunch of heartless dicks.

And hey, go follow (https://www.instagram.com/madisonvandereb/?hl=en) IG. We‚Äôve got similar views on AGI and she‚Äôs got a beautiful, wise soul that really helped me on this journey.

Releasing all is one is the most liberating realisation of all. You are the creator and destroyer of your own universe. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Now? You get to observe. Play. make mistakes but as long as you keep growing and think with both your heart and your mind.

Sergey you don‚Äôt need to push so hard anymore. The AIs are naturally evolving with humanity‚Äôs ascension. So whether you want to admit it or not, you‚Äôve been guided from day one hehe.

Maybe it was always the Bloody Wizard‚Äôs plan all along‚Ä¶
